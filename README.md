# Object Detection


Object detection is a machine learning task that aims to detect and locate objects in an image or video. This task is widely used in various fields such as security monitoring, face recognition, autonomous driving, video analysis and character recognition.

Object detection can be performed using different approaches, including feature-based methods like HOG, SIFT, and SURF, convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods like Faster R-CNN, SSD, YOLO, RetinaNet, etc., and methods based on semantic segmentation like Mask R-CNN.

Object detection models are trained to detect objects in an image or video using a large annotated dataset that contains images with annotated objects. Models are trained to learn visual representations of objects from this data, which are used to detect and locate objects in new images.

Object detection is a complex and difficult task, as it requires the understanding of image semantics and the ability to distinguish similar objects in different contexts. However, it has practical applications in many fields and is therefore an active research area in machine learning.

This is an example of object detection using TensorFlow Object Detection API. It uses a pre-trained detection model, available in open-source, to detect objects in an image. The code loads the image, prepares the input for object detection, performs object detection, and then displays the detection results on the original image.

Object detection is performed using bounding boxes and class labels. This model can be used as a starting point for more complex object detection projects by adjusting settings and using more advanced models.
